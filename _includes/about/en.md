Hey, my name is Qianxing Li(李乾行). I'm a Computer Sciences student at Stony Brook University who really enjoys solving complex engineering problems on software and robotics.

I build robots and program them with `C` since I was age 12. As Leader of VESIBAY Robotics, I leaded my team achieved remarkable success for VEX international competitions.

I was dissatisfied my apartment's HVAC control system, so I develop a IoT-based climate control system from hardware to software, including real-time body positioning and dynamic zonal control. With my automated solution, I was finally able to relax in a perfectly comfortable environment.

I recently joined a research team as a Research Assistant, where I build and program robots using `ROS2`.

I am always eager to grow, contribute to the community, and enjoy every step of the journey.
